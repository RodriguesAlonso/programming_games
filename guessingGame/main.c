Rules
The computer will think of a number, and you, the player, will need guess it.
Which each error, the machine will tell you whether the number kicked was greater or lower than thought.
You also be able to choose the difficulty level of the game, that will give you more or less opportunities to kick a number. 
At the end, if you win, the computer will tell you know how many points you have made, based on in how good your kicks were.
